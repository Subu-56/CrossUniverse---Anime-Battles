The minigame basically connects the jjba, bleach, hxh, jjk verses.

1 - Universe Connections: This minigame brings together the worlds of 
JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, Bleach, Hunter x Hunter, and Jujutsu Kaisen.

2 - Character Selection: Each universe has its 10 strongest characters and 10 powerful minor characters, making a total of 40 characters per verse. 
Players randomly receive one character from any of these verses.

3 - How to Win: To win, you’ll need to convince your opponent that your character can defeat theirs. Create battle scenarios, use imagination, and explain how your character’s abilities could overcome the opponent’s.
Character Knowledge: If you’re unfamiliar with a character’s abilities, you’re free to look them up or use ChatGPT for information. Just don’t ask ChatGPT who would win, since it can be SO WRONG sometimes.

Enjoy the game and the wild cross-universe battles! - Thank you for wasting your time on my shitty game :P
